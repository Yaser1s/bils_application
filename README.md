# Application Company marketing Dates

A Flutter project.
An application of invoices that originated in my graduation project and is on the team.
I developed a comprehensive invoice management system specifically tailored for the dates market. And is linked to all the departments that need to see their details:
First, for the company to manage the work, its effectiveness, and all the sections listed below.
Secondly, for merchants who work by trade and the merchants who work by credit. Merchants can easily track their buys and manage their accounts
Thirdly, Farmers can see what private drivers have sold on their farms and can see what money is left in their accounts.
Four and finally are the employees, who create new invoices and they differ in their powers.
The project was big for my knowledge of the language at that time.
